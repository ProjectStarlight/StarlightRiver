## Balance

- ↑ Facet and lattice damage 47 => 55, crit 10% => 19%, max buff multiplier 3x => 3.5x
- ↑ Coalescence damage 44 => 50
- ↑ Refractive blade laser damage 5% of base => 25% of base
- ↑ Phoeenix storm damage 40 => 60
- ↑ Starwood boomerang charge time 0.8s => 0.5s
- ↑ Aquatic manabond damage 24 => 26, fire rate 1/0.8s => 1/0.63s

- ↑ Electro arrows can now hit up to 4 targets, chain randomly instead of failing to chain if targets are already debuffed, and have refreshed audiovisual effects
- = Man eater pot now uses local immunity

- ↓ Corpseflower damage penalty 55% => 65%
- ↓ Druidic manabond now requires beeswax (queen bee drop) to craft
- ↓ Palestone nail now requires demonite/crimtane bars to craft instead of silver/tungsten
- ↓ Overflowing urn no longer deals direct hits in addition to its debuff damage (This is technically a bugfix but its so drastic for balance it belongs here)
- Glassweaver's forge will now have some mildly dangerous crystal growth on the ceiling in expert and quite dangerous crystal growth in expert. Put those grappling hooks away.
- Various boss damage values have been normalized across difficulties. In general, bosses should hit a bit harder on normal mode, a bit less on expert, and much less on master as compared to before
- Glassweaver is a slight exception to this as his direct attack damage was quite low previously, he should be much tougher on normal, a bit tougher on expert, and a wee smidge tougher on master
- Glassweaver now has proper master mode HP scaling, and has a bit of barrier on all difficulties to make him last a bit longer on his own.
- Various enemies throughout the game have had barrier added to them, and their life and defense decresed to make up for it. This should diversify combat a little bit. Notable inclusions are "caster" type enemies, demons, and the nebular branch of the lunar events.
- When holding an uncharged magnet, charged enemies spawn twice as often as previously
- Loot wraiths are more common
- Living blood drops more often

## Misc
- Various visual effects throughout the mod have been updated

## Fixes
- Fixed an issue where all stackable buffs failed to sync in multiplayer
- Fixed an issue where the cough drops did not grant a damage increase like the tooltip stated
- Fixed the text card popup when gaining an ability not dissappearing sometimes
- Made the glassweaver respawn himself better if he somehow goes missing
- Fixed cutaways drawing in subworlds where they should not exist
- Fixed the cooking station requiring one more free tile than it should to place
- Fixed some forest props being able to generate mid-air
- Alot of optimization changes, mostly around the vitric desert, particles, and lighting
- Updated AssGen to 3.0 to allow asset lazy loading which should speed up load times
- Updated to the latest StructureHelper version which should improve world generation time and decrease file size a bit

## Boring programmer stuff
- Keywords now utilize localization and are data driven similar to dialogue and hints
- Untied the text cards from the ability system to unwind a longstanding issue with it persisting after the intended period
