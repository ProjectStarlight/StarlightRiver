# Starlight River 0.3.0

## Content
- Added the heavy flail and frost flail, melee weapons with a heavy overhead swing

## Gameplay features
- Added a pool of unique 'cursed' prefixes for accessories, with up and downsides. All cursed accessories now only pull from this pool.
- You can gamble on applying one of these cursed prefixes to a normal item with a Drop of Darkness.

## UI
- Updated the defensive stat UI to better show various features of the mod and vanilla. You can click the defense icon in the inventory to expand the new UI
- Added a button to the barrier tincture slot to hide the barrier effect
- Added a popout tooltip for buffs similar to keywords. Various item's tooltips have been updated to utilize this.
- The keyword popout tooltip has been updated slightly

## Balance
- ↑ Base barrier recharge rate has increased from 6 to 10
- ↑ Facet and lattice damage 47 => 45, crit 10% => 19%, max buff multiplier 3x => 3.5x
- ↑ Coalescence damage 44 => 50
- ↑ Refractive blade laser damage 5% of base => 25% of base
- ↑ Phoeenix storm damage 40 => 60
- ↑ Starwood boomerang charge time 0.8s => 0.5s
- ↑ Aquatic manabond damage 24 => 26, fire rate 1/0.8s => 1/0.63s
- ↑ Aquamarine pendant max barrier 15 => 20, now has +4 barrier recharge rate
- ↑ Barrier potion restoration (lesser/normal/greater) 40/80/120 => 100/150/200, buff duration 3s/4s/5s => 5s/7s/10s
- = Man eater pot now uses local immunity
- = All manabonds now use local immunity
- ↓ Corpseflower damage penalty 55% => 65%
- ↓ Druidic manabond now requires beeswax (queen bee drop) to craft
- Various boss damage values have been normalized across difficulties. In general, bosses should hit a bit harder on normal mode, a bit less on expert, and much less on master as compared to before
- Various enemies throughout the game have had barrier added to them, and their life and defense decresed to make up for it. This should diversify combat a little bit. Notable inclusions are "caster" type enemies, demons, and the nebular branch of the lunar events.
- When holding an uncharged magnet, charged enemies spawn twice as often as previously
- Loot wraiths are more common
- Living blood drops more often

## Fixes
- Fixed an issue where all stackable buffs failed to sync in multiplayer
- Fixed an issue where the cough drops did not grant a damage increase like the tooltip stated
- Fixed the text card popup when gaining an ability not dissappearing sometimes
- Made the glassweaver respawn himself better if he somehow goes missing

## Boring programmer stuff
- Keywords now utilize localization and are data driven similar to dialogue and hints
- Untied the text cards from the ability system to unwind a longstanding issue with it persisting after the intended period
