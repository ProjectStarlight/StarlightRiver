# Starlight River 0.1.8: LukewarmFix3 is live!

## Fixes:
- Fixed Armillary Trial's adaptive damage reduction not applying to damage-over-time effects
- Fixed an issue where the jade stopwatch had strange interactions with held/charged items
- Tuned some Metal Detector values to better reflect the rarity of modded tiles
- Made meteors and moonstones avoid destroying Touchstone structures
- Fixed the Bloodbolter deleting bosses before they can drop loot
- Fixed accessories not taking effect when swapping loadouts
- Fixed overlays appearing where they shouldn't in boss rush
- Fixed a number of issues with Vitric Temple puzzles
- Fixed story NPCs spawning in the Armillary Trial
- Fixed the Twisted Greatsword duplicating itself
- Fixed infinite scaling on the Magmite Vacpac
- Fixed Bladesaw not cutting grass/pots
- Removed a legacy recipe for Gray Goo
- Fixed Inoculation not taking effect
- Fixed an unloading related crash

## Balancing:
- Adjusted the damage various boss and enemies deal. In general enemies should be less scary and bosses more scary
- Adjusted the Armillary Trial's adaptive DPS targets (~33% higher, should make it a little less bullet spongey)
- Reworked Defiled Ankh (Remove all debuffs while barrier is active ➜ Grants 100% inoculation and immunity to most debuffs while barrier is active)
- Increased Seaglass Ring's granted barrier (+10 Barrier ➜ +30 Barrier) and recharge delay reduction (-0.5s Barrier recharge delay ➜ -1s Barrier recharge delay)
- Increased Aqua Sapphire's granted barrier (+10 Barrier ➜ +20 Barrier) and barrier effectiveness (+5% Barrier Effectiveness ➜ +15% Barrier Effectiveness)
- Significantly increased Rune of Warding's granted barrier (+20 Barrier ➜ +50 Barrier)
- Reduced Tentalance damage (20 DMG ➜ 16 DMG)
- Reduced Sandscript mana cost (20 MP ➜ 3 MP)
- Reduced Gluttony mana cost (9 MP ➜ 3 MP)

## Sundries:
- Added short cutscenes when Vitric Temple puzzles are solved to make their completion more obvious
- Godrays from large trees now dim in the rain
- Updated the Recursive Focus' visual effects
- Improved the Armillary Trial death screen
- Retrained the Perfectly Generic Object's genericism generation neural network
