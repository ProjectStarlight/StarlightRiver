# Starlight River v0.1.7: LukewarmFix2 is live!
This patch is a small hotfix to address some minor issues, along with the Auroracle spawning bug, before we begin working on much more complicated fixes and actual new content.
## Fixes:
- Fixed Auroracle not spawning
- Fixed the blocks under loot chests and Touchstones being mineable
- Made Greenhouse Glass actually work on most vanilla plants
- Made meteors avoid Touchstones
- Fixed Earthduster recipe
## Content:
- Added recipe for Ignition Gauntlets (10 Hellstone Bars, 8 Ancient Ceramic, 2 Magmatic Cores)
 - Unleash a rapid flurry of punches, slowly gaining Ignition Charge as you deal damage
 - Hold RMB to consume Ignition Charge, launching yourself at your cursor at escape velocity and dealing damage to anything in the way
 - LMB while flying to vent remaining Ignition Charge, creating a large explosion wherever you aim
## Balancing:
* Corpseflower tick rate increased
* Slightly increased Impact SMG damage (4 ➜ 8 DMG), significantly increased Impact SMG's buff stacking (5% ➜ 10% more DMG per stack), greatly increased throw velocity, tripled explosion damage / explosion damage's buff scaling, and significantly reduced fire rate when overheated
## Sundries:
- Added new sound effects for Gunstrap Boots, Sandscript, and Octogun
- Made many sound effects much quieter
- Made Perfectly Generic Object actually more generic as the previous update in fact made it less generic
