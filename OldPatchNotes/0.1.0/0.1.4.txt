# Starlight River v0.1.4: Day Three is live!
This patch is another hotfix to address the less-impactful bugs that were missed in the last update, along with more balancing tweaks and enabling of previously-WIP items.
## Fixes:
* Fixed some accessories not properly being counted as Shoe Spikes
* Bombs can no longer break things they shouldn't be able to, again
* Hunter Potion no longer gives you wallhacks to see Artifacts
* Moonstone Hamaxe can no longer break temple walls
* Fixed an error with Nature's Gift artifact textures
* Fixed Large Trees hovering a pixel off the ground
* Made Disinfectant Kit actually give crit chance
* Added sell prices to an unholy amount of items
* Rune Staff now properly works with mana
* Fixed more tooltips, keywords, and typos
* Fixed Tainted Greataxe
## Content:
* Added recipe for the Death Sax weapon (30 Ebon/Shadewood, 10 Demonite/Crimtane Bars, and 10 Living Blood at a Demon Altar)
 * Dealing or taking damage with any other weapon slowly charges up the Death Sax and its primal roar, creating a large AoE of destruction on use
* Added recipe to the ULTRAPILLS accessory (15 Living Blood and 10 Demonite/Crimtane Bars at a Demon Altar)
 * Dealing damage and killing enemies creates a shower of blood that heals you
 * Cursed: You can not heal by any other means
* Added recipe for the Magebane accessory (Shimmer a Mana Flower)
 * Dealing magic damage leeches mana from enemies
 * Cursed: You can not use Mana Potions or any other recovery item
* Added recipe for the Cogwheel mount (15 Desert Fossils and 4 Ancient Gears at an anvil)
 * A platform mount with a cog underneath it that can climb walls and deal damage to enemies at high enough speeds
* Added recipe for the Steamsaw melee weapon (Bladesaw and 6 Ancient Gears at an avil)
 * Shreds enemies in melee with a circular saw that builds up pressure, released when letting go of M1 to launch the blade at high velocity
* Added recipe for the Jetwelder summon weapon (5 Ancient Ceramic and 6 Ancient Gears at an anvil)
 * Fires a superheated jet flame that deals summon tag damage and creates Scrap from slain enemies, which can be consumed to construct temporary steampunk robots
* Added a recipe for the Rebar Launcher ranged weapon (12 Hellstone Bars and 6 Ancient Gears at an anvil)
 * Launches high velocity rebar into enemies at range, embedding in their flesh. With good aim, this rebar can then be struck *again* by *more rebar* to drive it deeper into the enemy

## QoL:
* Merchant and Skeleton Merchant now sell Flares if you have a Flare Breacher in your inventory
* Sparkling bullets can stack to 9999

## Balancing:
* Corpseflower damage multiplier increased (33% ➜ 45%), but you can no longer proc oncrit effects on initial weapon hits
* Greatly increased Rune Staff's damage (8 ➜ 16 DMG)
* Rune Staff projectiles now home in on enemies

## Sundries:
- Beautified even more sprites and visuals (Tiger, Snake, and Mantis Techniques, Martial Encyclopedia, Glass Arrowhead, Warded Mail, Acorn Sprout, Starwood Charm, Boomerang, and Staff, Twisted Greatsword, Staff of Self-Dissasembly, Copper & Tin Coils)
- Made the Perfectly Generic Object a little more generic
