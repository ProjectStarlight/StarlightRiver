# Starlight River
Welcome to the _Starlight River_ repository. This repository is public purely for the benefit of the community, as it provides resources for learning.

If you wish to play the Mod, we recommend waiting for an official release, beta, or demo to use instead, as the Mod is still a work-in-progress and some unfinished content may leave a sour taste in your mouth due to its unfinished state. You may also spoil some mechanics or progression, as well as grow to expect features that will not make it into the full release.

The Mod is **not** ready, do not ruin it for yourself
