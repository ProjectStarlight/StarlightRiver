[h1]Now in Open Alpha![/h1]

[h3]Starlight River features...[/h3]
Stunning and unique multi-phase bosses, challenging encounters, tons of unique weapons for every class, a dynamic and in-depth approach to buildcrafting, and tons of secrets.
Will you walk the path countless shattered civilizations left behind? Will you harness the energies that destroyed them? Will you claim Starlight and make it your own? Will you find the Armillary? Will you unravel the weave of fate? Or will you be forgotten, lost in the space between constellations?


[h3]Now releasing as an Open Alpha...[/h3]
We're looking to get as much feedback as possible from our amazing community to help us continue driving the mod higher and higher towards its eventual full 1.0 release.
You can treat this as, by all intents and purposes, a playable release build. Just be aware that bugs are likely, and we're still working on a lot of content! We're doing this primarily so that we can expand the scope of our testing, and quickly polish and fill in the gaps in the coming months with the valuable feedback our community gives us.


[h3]Warning:[/h3]
Like all content mods, Starlight River is best experienced as the main focus of a modpack. Do not report balance inconsistencies or progression skips when played with other large mods.
Starlight River does not support multiplayer. It is technically playable, but extremely buggy.
This is an open alpha release. Everything here is subject to change.
